# THE-LINUX-FOUNDATION
These training courses provided by the Linux Foundation have enabled me to strengthen my skills in cybersecurity, blockchain and securing software chains.

I have completed several courses provided by the Linux Foundation to strengthen my skills in cybersecurity and emerging technologies:
- Securing the Software Supply Chain: SBOM and Signatures (LFEL1007)
- Blockchain: Understanding Its Uses and Implications (LFS170)
- Cybersecurity Essentials (LFC108)
These courses allowed me to deepen my knowledge in key areas such as software supply chain security, practical applications of blockchain, and core cybersecurity principles.
